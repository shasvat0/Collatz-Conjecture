The Collatz-Conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.


Description of “the conjecture” :

If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2, if n is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n+1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
